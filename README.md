# MATLAB-Image-Restoration
Image restoration techniques in MATLAB

-	SVD Image decomposition with 5% and 10% to reduce the memory storage of the digital image and to retain as much of the quality as possible, applied factorization of that matrix into three matrices and represented the image with smaller set of values.
-	Unsharp Masking with 0.7 and 1.5 alpha percentage to blurred image to enhance details
-	Gaussian Low Pass Filter of radius 20 to reduce noise (high frequency components) and blurring regions with smoothness
-	Arithmetic, Harmonic and Geometric Means to smoothen image with gaussian noise
-	Geometric Mean Filter on an image with noise and blur on OX
